The input is an array of three sub-arrays with each sub-array containing 4 elements.2. There is a specific order in which these sub-arrays are transformed in the output. The order in transformations is 3rd, 1st, 2nd, 2nd, 1st, 3rd.3. Each sub-array's transformation includes adding its 3rd and 4th elements in starting and 1st and 2nd elements in the end.4. The order of these four elements (3rd, 4th ,1st, 2nd) is preserved and this combined sequence repeated twice forms the resultant sub-array. Hence resultant sub-array has 8 elements in total.5. The resultant 6 sub-arrays following the above operation, ordered as described in step 2, form the final output array.", "1. For each sublist, the elements from index 2 and 3, are taken and made into a new sublist of four elements.2. Then, the elements from index 0 and 1 are taken and made into a new sublist of four elements.3. The process is repeated for each sublist in the input array, making the new sublists.4. The output is created by appending these new sublists to an array in order.5.
