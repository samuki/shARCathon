Apply this description to the following test input and write you answer as 'Out: '\nIn: [32] [[78]", "result": "\nOut: [795959] [[719199]\nThis is a common task for those who do analysis of binary functions, where binary data is always shown either in a 'R' or in an 'A' format.\nYou have some binary data that looks like the following. To find all the values like 5 or 6 or 7 or 9 or 11 then you could make many guesses as follows. I know that every input value is a fixed value - but I can take all values and find them, so lets think for a moment!\nA) Output: 5 or 6 or 7 or 9 or 11 = 7, 9, 11 0 B) Input: 5 or 6 or 7 or 9 or 11 = 7 B) Output: 5 or 6 or 7 or 9 or 11 = 7 00011A = 7 + 9, 11\nB) Input: 5 or 6 or 7 or 9 or 11 = 7 00011B = 5 - 9, 11\nB) Output: 5 or 6 or 7 or 9 or 11 = 7 00111A = 7 + 9, 11\nNow you know how to find all the inputs with the given fixed value. Use the above method to find all the answers in the following example output. Here is how to find two of the three answers in that output.\nA) Output: 6 + 6 + 7 = 7, 9, 11 A) Input: 6 of 6 = 7 A) Output: 6 + 6 + 7 = 7 00111A = 7 + 9, 11\nThis is a common problem that needs to be solved with an algorithm where you must determine the correct answer and the correct sum.\nIf you look at the above example output you will recognise that there is only output of value 7 and that there are two answers - both of which need to have 7 times the value as output. In terms of numbers that is a fixed number. When you use some other form of input - you always have the possibility of missing information. For example, if you had input '4' and got '1+5' as output. Then the fact that you have got as output '1+5' must mean that you knew what '1' and '5' are. Because you used a binary input you cannot know whether the answer is '1' or '5'.\nYou can also apply this method to some real world problems. Some inputs will show a number if the number is a fixed value. For example, say you have two digits of the year and a binary input, say 4, in this input the value is 6. It is not surprising that the value would be 6 (because it is a fixed value).\nIn these types of inputs there are some types of mistakes, where you might make a'mistake' that is not the value of the input. For example if you know that '4' and '1' are fixed, and you input a 4, you might get '1' instead of the first number you thought you heard, which is 6, the mistake. In the last example it is very likely that you will have made a value mistake, because you were using a binary input, when you may have really got '1'.\nIn most cases you can find the value of an input value, whether it is a fixed value, binary input, fixed point or even a combination of the three. Once this answer has been calculated then you are told the value of the input that holds for every possible combination of values.\nA) Output: 4 (2) 4 (4) 4 (2) 4 (6) 4 (2) 6 4 (4) 8 (6) 8 4 (4) 16 4 (7) 28\nA) Input: 4 (2) 4 (4) 4 (2) 6 (2) 4 (4) 8 (4) 4 (4) 32 4 (7) 42 4 (7) 57 4 (7) 64\nA) Output: 4 (2) 4 (6) 4 (2) 6 (2) 4 (4) 16 (2) 4 (4) 40 4 (7) 61 4 (7) 64\nAll those values are correct, which is amazing.\nAfter working out the answer to this problem you have the means", "exp_result": "Out: [323232] [[787878] [[232323] [[878787] [[323232] [[787878]"}, {"prompt": "Do the following:\nWhat is the step by step description of the input/output relation that holds for all example input/output pairs?\nIn: [070] [[777] [[070]\nOut: [000707000] [[000000000] [[000707000] [[707707707] [[000000000] [[707707707] [[000707000] [[000000000] [[000707000]\nIn: [006] [[060] [[600]\nOut: [000000660] [[000000606] [[000000066] [[000660000] [[000606000] [[000066000] [[660000000] [[606000000] [[066000000]\nIn: [440] [[004] [[004]\nOut: [004004000] [[440440000] [[440440000] [[000000004] [[000000440] [[000000440] [[000000004] [[000000440] [[000000440]\nYou now have all the information to solve the task.
