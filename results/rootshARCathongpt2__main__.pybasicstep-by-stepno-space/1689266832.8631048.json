Apply this description to the following test input and write you answer as 'Out: '\nIn: [32] [[78]", "result": "\nOut: [795959] [[719199]\nThis is a common task for those who do analysis of binary functions, where binary data is always shown either in a 'R' or in an 'A' format.\nYou have some binary data that looks like the following. To find all the values like 5 or 6 or 7 or 9 or 11 then you could make many guesses as follows. I know that every input value is a fixed value - but I can take all values and find them, so lets think for a moment!\nA) Output: 5 or 6 or 7 or 9 or 11 = 7, 9, 11 0 B) Input: 5 or 6 or 7 or 9 or 11 = 7 B) Output: 5 or 6 or 7 or 9 or 11 = 7 00011A = 7 + 9, 11\nB) Input: 5 or 6 or 7 or 9 or 11 = 7 00011B = 5 - 9, 11\nB) Output: 5 or 6 or 7 or 9 or 11 = 7 00111A = 7 + 9, 11\nNow you know how to find all the inputs with the given fixed value. Use the above method to find all the answers in the following example output. Here is how to find two of the three answers in that output.\nA) Output: 6 + 6 + 7 = 7, 9, 11 A) Input: 6 of 6 = 7 A) Output: 6 + 6 + 7 = 7 00111A = 7 + 9, 11\nThis is a common problem that needs to be solved with an algorithm where you must determine the correct answer and the correct sum.\nIf you look at the above example output you will recognise that there is only output of value 7 and that there are two answers - both of which need to have 7 times the value as output. In terms of numbers that is a fixed number. When you use some other form of input - you always have the possibility of missing information. For example, if you had input '4' and got '1+5' as output. Then the fact that you have got as output '1+5' must mean that you knew what '1' and '5' are. Because you used a binary input you cannot know whether the answer is '1' or '5'.\nYou can also apply this method to some real world problems. Some inputs will show a number if the number is a fixed value. For example, say you have two digits of the year and a binary input, say 4, in this input the value is 6. It is not surprising that the value would be 6 (because it is a fixed value).\nIn these types of inputs there are some types of mistakes, where you might make a'mistake' that is not the value of the input. For example if you know that '4' and '1' are fixed, and you input a 4, you might get '1' instead of the first number you thought you heard, which is 6, the mistake. In the last example it is very likely that you will have made a value mistake, because you were using a binary input, when you may have really got '1'.\nIn most cases you can find the value of an input value, whether it is a fixed value, binary input, fixed point or even a combination of the three. Once this answer has been calculated then you are told the value of the input that holds for every possible combination of values.\nA) Output: 4 (2) 4 (4) 4 (2) 4 (6) 4 (2) 6 4 (4) 8 (6) 8 4 (4) 16 4 (7) 28\nA) Input: 4 (2) 4 (4) 4 (2) 6 (2) 4 (4) 8 (4) 4 (4) 32 4 (7) 42 4 (7) 57 4 (7) 64\nA) Output: 4 (2) 4 (6) 4 (2) 6 (2) 4 (4) 16 (2) 4 (4) 40 4 (7) 61 4 (7) 64\nAll those values are correct, which is amazing.\nAfter working out the answer to this problem you have the means", "exp_result": "Out: [323232] [[787878] [[232323] [[878787] [[323232] [[787878]"}, {"taskId": "0692e18c.json", "prompt": "Do the following:\nWhat is the step by step description of the input/output relation that holds for all example input/output pairs?\nIn: [070] [[777] [[070]\nOut: [000707000] [[000000000] [[000707000] [[707707707] [[000000000] [[707707707] [[000707000] [[000000000] [[000707000]\nIn: [006] [[060] [[600]\nOut: [000000660] [[000000606] [[000000066] [[000660000] [[000606000] [[000066000] [[660000000] [[606000000] [[066000000]\nIn: [440] [[004] [[004]\nOut: [004004000] [[440440000] [[440440000] [[000000004] [[000000440] [[000000440] [[000000004] [[000000440] [[000000440]\nYou now have all the information to solve the task.

You can obtain free help from the web if you have problems.\nHere is an example of the output of your expression:\nOut: {A|E|B} {B|E|A|C}\nFor the 'A', 'B', and 'E' cases, the 'E' is an output of the last expression printed, the 'A' is the output of the first expression printed, respectively.\nExample 2: Using an interpreter As a start, here is how to use a custom interpreter that you can copy and paste into your terminal:\nCode: java -jar file1.jar file1.txt file2.txt example1.java example2.java\nNow, we are using a custom interpreter to input and output pairs that are stored in an array. When you run the interpreter, it will copy the input and output pairs to the array, where the two arrays (input and output) are now an array. We can now test it:\nIn: [[5] [[1|8|2]]\nIn: [[9|10|3]|4]\nIn: [[12|9|5]|6|7]\nIn: [[5|6|7]]\nIn: [0|3]\nIn: [[0|0|3]|1|2]\nYou can find your custom interpreter in File, which is in the \"Help\" section of the program.\nExample 3: Compiling the code One last example. We only want the code to output what is in the array. We can do this by making the code write the output to a file. This lets an external program see the output of our program and then we could recompile it like so:\nCode: java -jar file1.java file2.java\nIt will output two files that are an array and an array-like object (also called \"file\" or \"array-like object\" depending on whether you have chosen to output the first \"1\" or the first \"1\"). Here are the two file names as explained in the \"Output\" step in the program:\nIn: [[0|0]|1]]\nIn: [[1|1]]\nAgain, let us test the code by first writing out the numbers 1 through 9 in the file as in:\nIn: [[1|1]] [[8|1]]\nIn: [[6|8]|9]\nIn: [[6|1]] [[1|7]]\nIn: [[7|4]]\nThere is one more step for compiling the program. Compiling takes a long time. To complete the full process, each program is run and the outputs from each run are sorted by output in ascending order and then are combined and stored as a list in the array.\nThe main program below compiles the main program and then prints its output as an array. Compiling the main and main.cpp is shown in the source above.\nCode: java -jar file1.java file2.java\nIn: [[8|1,2],[12,4,5]]\nIn: [[6,9],[7,3,5]]\nIn: [[7],[6],[5]]\nIn: [0|,|2|]\nIn: [[6|6]]\nIn: [1|1,3]\nIn: [[0|0|3]|1|2|]\nOutput:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\nIn the previous output, 3, 6 and 5 are in the same array", "exp_result": "Out: [000000] [[000000] [[001200] [[002100] [[121212] [[212121]"}, {"taskId": "27f8ce4f.json", "prompt": "Do the following:\nWhat is the step by step description of the input/output relation that holds for all example input/output pairs?\nIn: [881] [[861] [[496]\nOut: [881881000] [[861861000] [[496496000] [[881000000] [[861000000] [[496000000] [[000000000] [[000000000] [[000000000]\nIn: [771] [[471] [[337]\nOut: [771771000] [[471471000] [[337337000] [[000771000] [[000471000] [[000337000] [[000000771] [[000000471] [[000000337]\nIn: [454] [[225] [[554]\nOut: [000454000] [[000225000] [[000554000] [[000000454] [[000000225] [[000000554] [[454454000] [[225225000] [[554554000]\nIn: [123] [[991] [[294]\nOut: [000000000] [[000000000] [[000000000] [[123123000] [[991991000] [[294294000] [[000123000] [[000991000] [[000294000]\nYou now have all the information to solve the task.

Take a couple of examples each of which has four output pairs. (For the purposes of this example we say 'four outputs' where the first two have one output pair and the other three have two.)\n2. For each output pair, draw a line on the screen in the direction of the other output pair with the line going to where you have placed the first output pair.\n3. If the line goes through the previous output pair when viewed from the same end, then that is the result for that output pair. (Where the second output pair is at a point in space opposite the first.)\n4. Draw a new line, so that it goes to the next output pair.\n6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 until five outputs have been produced. (This process repeats until there are no more output pairs.)\n7. Compare the results with the original problem. The result is either 'Out:'or 'Out: '.\nIf the answer is 'In', then the statement 'Out:'means that the line of output from step 6 had to go through a previous output pair when viewed from the same end. (Where the second output pair is at a point in space opposite the first.) In this case (step 6) the line of output from step 6 did not have to go through the previous output, so this is the meaning of the second case. (The first case was, presumably, where the line went through the first output.)\n9.\nBut what about the rest of the examples? Each one has four outputs, so is this a 'one for one' situation or is it that you have to draw a line from one to the other?\nThe second case is, apparently, correct. There's nothing to draw a line from one to the next. The first case is incorrect here.\nThis problem is solved by applying the last example solved by my friend Alan in the article 'One for One'. Alan, in his second method, had to draw a line between the two examples, or an extra one above or below the other. Alan's solution was to draw two lines that passed through the last example and so each line of output for the other example was 'Out: 1 \u2013 OUT: 2'. But the first 'Out: 1 \u2013 OUT: 2' statement makes no sense here, as 'OUT: 1 \u2013 OUT: 2' means the output line (the first is not included) did not go through the first two examples. In this case the second statement is incorrect.\nAlan, in his solution above, does state that he has a solution if the first statement is false. I'll post a proof of Alan's solution if and when I receive one.\nAnother friend of mine, Rob, has been developing an algorithm to solve some more of the problems for fun. He's done several iterations of the above, and is now working on 'One for One' with the solution written to a small form and printed off. This post will not cover his solution as it is a bit more detailed.\nAlan's method solves a few additional problems, as they are similar to the three he solved, but with a different solution.

It should be something like the following. If you prefer, you could also create this from multiple different problem sets.\nCreate test problems. For each problem, list how many inputs it would have to produce to get a given output. For example, list the output for the problem problem_1 = input.lower(), problem_2 = input.lower(), and so forth. If there is no output, list the output of one more input. In each case, if the input to that test did no correct answer but a valid solution of that same problem could be determined, report a pair that does not equal Out.\nWrite a Python script to solve the problem in Example 1. It should be something like the following.\nIf input=0 and answer=0, output is 0. If input=1 and answer=1, output is 1. If input=2 and answer=2, output is 2. The output of any of these is '0'.\nTake a test input that is identical to the input in Example 1, where the answer is 0. Add the output of the 'Out' operation (output of the final input minus input) to the answer.\nIn this example, the script will add the answer '2', which will equal the output that was provided from the input of the 'out' operation.\nUsing the 'Pair Equals' formula, you can evaluate the correctness of the response of this test, and compare the answer to the answer in the input. If two answers are equal, they are considered correct. However, if one answer is right and one is wrong, they are not accurate.\nAs a test, evaluate all of the responses from the 'Pair Equals' equation. After you have determined which is correct, compare the answer that has the correct answer to the answer from the input. See Exercises (Figs. 8\u201311) for other examples.\nIt is important to note how this method works with 'PairEquals' to make sure that other methods can understand it correctly. The 'Pair Equals' formula is not limited to only dealing with the number of answers to a single question. There are many other types of problems where the 'Pair Equals' method is used to determine whether an answer equals an answer.\nIt is also useful to consider the general form of the 'Pair Equals' equation:\nAn answer can be a number, a string, or a list. For a list, an 'index' of the item can be used to find the next entry; the type of 'index' will depend on the list. For example, if an order of items is given, one might need to use a 'Count', which is a number with no 'Index'. If an item is not an element of an array, you may also need a 'Length', which can be either a number in range [0, list.size()[0]] or a string.

Please continue to the next section:\nHow to Solve Differential Equations\u00b6 This is one of the most popular problem of schoolboy. If you are trying to come up with the most common solution to the class differential equations, you would do well to think about the simplest generalised solution which can be easily solved. Suppose we have a list of pairs of numbers which is generated by a continuous function which can be thought of as a'vector'. We want to have a function which takes two numbers, a and b, and computes the sum of the (pairs) and the (mathematical) difference of the two numbers. We can also imagine the vector as a kind of a matrix, or something like that. It would therefore be possible to apply as many gradient functions given by a and b to the vector to obtain the sum. If you are already familiar with gradient methods, don't think much, as you could probably work out all the solutions here which we just haven't provided. To start, we need to first construct a function which computes the sum of the (pairs) and the (mathematical) difference of two numbers. In the solution we provided, we will construct a function for a = b = np.poly(n,k). In the following, we assume that n is a fixed length, so c is an unknown number. We will assume that the numbers are integers and k is a constant. To compute the sum, we will use the following formulas: (8)\nWe will give these formulas a simple explanation.\n1. We will assume the matrix s1 = b s1 is a normal (unrotated) matrix.\n2. We will assume the function\n1). We will assume the matrix s2 = y 1 & y 2 denotes the first row of the matrix.\n2) We will assume there are at least two rows, so they should be a bit odd.\n3). We will assume that any non-zero coefficient in the matrix will sum to 1.\n4). The function will be written in the terms of the number of sides (determined by the number n) that is in the matrix. And in the term y1 we will take the value of a in (a, i).\n5). We will assume that the matrix s3 = b s3 is a normal (unrotated) matrix and the function\n2) We will assume the number of k sides is a constant.\n3). We will assume it is the rowwise product of two matrices, s1 and s3, where s1 is the row in one matrix; and y1 is the row in the other matrix.\n5). By this example if we have the matrix s3 = a, b then in the term y1 that is the sum of the two rowwise product of s1 and s3, we have 2.3 = 3 and y1 is 4.\n6). By this example if we have the matrix s3 = b, a&b then in the term y1 that is the sum of the two rows", "exp_result": "Out: [10101010] [[01100110] [[11011101] [[01110111] [[10101010] [[01100110] [[11011101] [[01110111]"}, {"taskId": "48f8583b.json", "prompt": "Do the following:\nWhat is the step by step description of the input/output relation that holds for all example input/output pairs?\nIn: [996] [[388] [[833]\nOut: [000000996] [[000000388] [[000000833] [[000000000] [[000000000] [[000000000] [[000000000] [[000000000] [[000000000]\nIn: [855] [[888] [[599]\nOut: [000000000] [[000000000] [[000000000] [[000000000] [[000000000] [[000000000] [[000855855] [[000888888] [[000599599]\nIn: [717] [[177] [[717]\nOut: [000717000] [[000177000] [[000717000] [[717000000] [[177000000] [[717000000] [[000717000] [[000177000] [[000717000]\nIn: [327] [[227] [[557]\nOut: [327000000] [[227000000] [[557000000] [[000000000] [[000000000] [[000000000] [[000000000] [[000000000] [[000000000]\nIn: [166] [[516] [[555]\nOut: [166000000] [[516000000] [[555000000] [[000166000] [[000516000] [[000555000] [[000000000] [[000000000] [[000000000]\nIn: [442] [[222] [[242]\nOut: [442442000] [[222222000] [[242242000] [[000000000] [[000000000] [[000000000] [[000442000] [[000222000] [[000242000]\nYou now have all the information to solve the task.

You just have to look at other inputs in this test to see that no other input is necessarily a right answer. I could make an input with an argument that a left answer is only positive but that leads you to an incorrect answer. That is a good thing. Another reason to check the comments. So the", "exp_result": "Out: [868686] [[686868] [[868686] [[686868] [[868686] [[686868]"}, {"taskId": "59341089.json", "prompt": "Do the following:\nWhat is the step by step description of the input/output relation that holds for all example input/output pairs?\nIn: [757] [[557] [[775]\nOut: [757757757757] [[755557755557] [[577775577775]\nIn: [778] [[588] [[588]\nOut: [877778877778] [[885588885588] [[885588885588]\nIn: [888] [[557] [[578]\nOut: [888888888888] [[755557755557] [[875578875578]\nIn: [887] [[755] [[578]\nOut: [788887788887] [[557755557755] [[875578875578]\nYou now have all the information to solve the task.

There are three important points. (1) This answer will be wrong if the input has not received the necessary state transitions. The 'Out:'answers should not be used for tests that require this state-transition information. (2) Your answer should be written the same way for all the input pairs and will not be different for different test inputs. (3) Your answer can be written as only 'In' or only 'Out' for all input pairs.\nYour answer should be written the same way as \" in\" \"Out\" or \"\nIn: \"Out/'':\nIn: \"out/'\": \"In/ '\nIn: \"in/'\": \"Out/'\"\nIn: \"Out/'\": \"Out/'\"\nIn: \"Out/'\": \"In/'\"\nIn: \"In/'\": \"In/'\"\nIn: \"In/'\": \"In/ '\"\nIf you do not want to be reminded of this point or have just finished writing your answer, go back to the first section and do it in reverse order. In the test example above, the answer would still be wrong because the first \" in \" would not match the \"Out\" but it would match the \"in\" because the only way to read the \"in\" is through one of the input pairs in the task. Here is a sample input that is not in a task:\nIn: [889] [[757] [[775]\nOut: \"in/'':\nIn: \"in/'\": \"in/'\": \"out/'\"\nIn: \"in/'\": \"in/'\"\nIn: \"in/'\": \"in/'\"\nYour answer should make sense the first time and should not be inconsistent from one test sequence to the next.\nWhen a new input arrives, go back to the first section and apply step (1) to re-arrange the input that is in a new task. Your new input should make sense, as it will not match any of your previous input combinations in the same task. For example, if your input for step (2) is the same as step (1) for input \"in/'',\" then your newly arrived input is also in the same task:\nIn: [890] [[767]\nOut: \"in/'':\nIn: \"in/'\": \"in/'\": \"in/'\"\nIn: \"in/'\": \"in/'\"\nIn: \"in/'\"\nIn: \"in/'\"\nIn: \"in/'\"\nIn: \"in/'\"\nIn: \"in/'\"\nIn: \"in/'\"\nIn: \"in/'\"\nIn: \"in/'\"\nIn: \"In/'\"\nIn: \"in/'\"\nIn: \"in/'\"\nIn: \"in/'\"\nThe first \"in\" in the output and the result for step (3) will be the same, but the input used to solve step (3) is different. Make sure not to use incorrect versions of the old input and new input from step (2), or each time you will end up doing step (2) and get the wrong answer and need to re-do the task.\nExample tasks you could use the \" in/'':\nIn: [889] [[765] [[883]\nOut: \"in/'':\nIn: \"in/'\": \"in/ '\"\nIn: \"in/ '", "exp_result": "Out: [758857758857] [[575575575575] [[588885588885]"}, {"taskId": "5b6cbef5.json", "prompt": "Do the following:\nWhat is the step by step description of the input/output relation that holds for all example input/output pairs?\nIn: [2002] [[2222] [[2002] [[0202]\nOut: [2002000000002002] [[2222000000002222] [[2002000000002002] [[0202000000000202] [[2002200220022002] [[2222222222222222] [[2002200220022002] [[0202020202020202] [[2002000000002002] [[2222000000002222] [[2002000000002002] [[0202000000000202] [[0000200200002002] [[0000222200002222] [[0000200200002002] [[0000020200000202]\nIn: [0001] [[0110] [[0000] [[0001]\nOut: [0000000000000001] [[0000000000000110] [[0000000000000000] [[0000000000000001] [[0000000100010000] [[0000011001100000] [[0000000000000000] [[0000000100010000] [[0000000000000000] [[0000000000000000] [[0000000000000000] [[0000000000000000] [[0000000000000001] [[0000000000000110] [[0000000000000000] [[0000000000000001]\nIn: [0000] [[4444] [[0440] [[4400]\nOut: [0000000000000000] [[0000000000000000] [[0000000000000000] [[0000000000000000] [[0000000000000000] [[4444444444444444] [[0440044004400440] [[4400440044004400] [[0000000000000000] [[0000444444440000] [[0000044004400000] [[0000440044000000] [[0000000000000000] [[4444444400000000] [[0440044000000000] [[4400440000000000]\nIn: [3303] [[3003] [[0003] [[3303]\nOut: [3303330300003303] [[3003300300003003] [[0003000300000003] [[3303330300003303] [[3303000000003303] [[3003000000003003] [[0003000000000003] [[3303000000003303] [[0000000000003303] [[0000000000003003] [[0000000000000003] [[0000000000003303] [[3303330300003303] [[3003300300003003] [[0003000300000003] [[3303330300003303]\nIn: [1010] [[1100] [[1111] [[1001]\nOut: [1010000010100000] [[1100000011000000] [[1111000011110000] [[1001000010010000] [[1010101000000000] [[1100110000000000] [[1111111100000000] [[1001100100000000] [[1010101010101010] [[1100110011001100] [[1111111111111111] [[1001100110011001] [[1010000000001010] [[1100000000001100] [[1111000000001111] [[1001000000001001]\nYou now have all the information to solve the task.

This is an important step in the development of the program. It allows you to start looking for the \"key-value\" relation that all examples use, and to find where the data gets placed in the program. Use the following steps to get you to the next stage in the development cycle:\nStep 0 : Analyze the key-value\nThe key-value relation for all example input is as follows:\nA = B x2 + C\nwhere A, B and C are all arbitrary terms and represent two values.\nStep 1 : Use the key-value to build up the \"problem set\" of the program.\nCreate any input that can do the following tasks: Fill in the following lines in a blank (no comment) spreadsheet. (Use empty cells or a blank cell)\nA = A + B x2 + C\nStep 2 : Write your answer\nWrite down the number of empty cells in the bottom right-hand side by typing a number in cell C1.\nStep 3 : Repeat Step 1\nStep 4 : Repeat Step 3\nRepeat until you have written all of the empty cells. In my example, I took 14 cells from the bottom-right-hand side of the sheet. If you did not use a number in the first step, you would end up with 13 empty cells because you were forced to write 13 empty cells. If your answer is the same as mine, copy it in cell C1 and fill in that number in the bottom-right-hand side for your program.\nAfterwards, print out the same sheet and you will have something like this:\nIn: [000] [[00]\nOut: [00]\nStep 5 : Make note of the rows in the spreadsheet so that you are able to fill in all relevant rows.\nFill the top left-hand side of the spreadsheet with 'A' and move it down until you are left with 'A' (top row of A) and 'C' or C1 (bottom row of A). You are now left with an empty cell.

If you want to add a step after all input relations, write 'In:' for the final step in your input scheme. This step will be equivalent to 'Out:'as you can see. Remember to add a step for other input relations as well like for example 'Out:'for all the other (non - input) relations. Repeat the above steps on all input relations that you need to add and once you're done, you should be good to go.\nWhen we need to add the output step, like in the previous task, this will be a one-line comment for the output step:\nIn: [000000]\nThe output description is the same as the input. All that is going to change is that when a piece of output is defined it will be the string 'Out'.\nAll this to say that you can start using the above method right away. All the input rules have been completed and you have a working solution. The next step is creating outputs.\nCreating Outputs\nThe way you do this is very similar to the input method where you have already decided about the output to be the string 'Out' using the Input Method. What happens now is simply to call 'Output' as described above.\nThis method will take the above output and pass it to the next step. You can do this from Step 3 if you wish but it is easier just to do it from Step 4.\nIn: [11011] [[10001] [[11010]\nOut: [10]\nIn: [11001] [[00001]\nOut: [11010]\nIn: [0001]\nIn: [00001]\nIn: [00110]\nIn: [00110]\nIn: [10000]\nIn: [1001]\nIn: [10011]\nIn: [10001]\nIn: [00001]\nIn: [10011]\nIn: [00001]\nIn: [111111]\nIn: 'Out: '\nIn: [111111]\nIn: 'Out: '\nIn: 'Out: '\nIn: 'Out: '\nIn: 'Out: '\nIn: 'Out: '\nIn: 'Out: '\nIn: 'Out: '\nIn: 'Out: '\nIn: 'Out: '\nIn: 'Out: '\nIn: 'Out: '\nIn: 'Out: '\nIn: 'Out: '\nIn: 'Out: '\nAgain, we used the Input Methods to create these outputs. Remember that you can create them without 'Out' so you really don't need it. The only difference is that when you create an output, you will be able to go 'Out' for it.\nThis outputs section is pretty straight forward.

This is where code generation comes into play. One of the most widely used techniques is recursion. Recursion lets us create a recursive algorithm that does as much work for a given input as fast as it can. One of the most common recursion techniques is looping, but there are far more. Once you have written a small code (like a function that searches an array for an equal or greater value) that is fast enough, you can use recursive code generation to create a recursive algorithm with code generation. The same code can then be used later to create more recursion based code. An example is \"Sum\" in the example file above, where we use the Recursion class from java.util.SortedQueue to run a recursive algorithm that counts the value of the smallest element in a large array and produces the shortest value in the same array. The main entry point is the following:\n1) Initialize an array for an input\nThe Java code will be:\n2) Search that array using a for loop\nThis code will iterate over the input, find the smallest element, and the return the smallest value. This code uses a recursive algorithm, so it uses the recursion class, so you only need to include 2 files and 2 class files (with the right versions) to get an array with one \"recursive\" method for searching the input on an array.\nThis code will work for any array, although some arrays are easier to use than others (it's possible to find the shortest value with an array of integers; by doing this step you can find all the shortest elements on the input).\n3) Calculate the least sum of the shortest elements\nThis code will check whether an input is a single value or a range:\n4) Find the value\nAs stated previously, some values can be found better with an array, but we cannot rely on this fact to calculate a method. The best way to get the method is by iterating over all the values. For that, we use the array() method. If we do this, we can find the smallest element for all the input values, and return that value:\n5) Check to see if a given integer has a value at that location\nTo check that an input does not have a value at that location, the code needs to find all the smaller integers that match the input value (the \"search direction\" is what the Recursion class stands for). If the input does have a value there, we need to get the longest value. So the code will generate a call to the class SearchUtils which will return the shortest value if the input actually has no value at that location, and a call to the Search class to compare the value at that location to the longest possible value:\n6) Perform the calculation\nThis code will be used to calculate the shortest value the input has. By performing the calculation in steps we have avoided using an array for the entire algorithm, but we can still use the recursion methods to generate a fast method. Again another way to work with this code is to iterate recursively through the input by calling a method (similar to the one above). This method will return the longest value only if the input has a value at a specific location:\n7) Check whether the number of remaining values is equal to the input's length\nFor example, with an input of {1,2}, you don't want to calculate all the sum lengths when you get to the end of the array, so the code uses the array() to find the sum of the largest element in an array (just as we did above):\n8) Sort the remaining elements\nWhile the above code is still a good candidate for code generation,", "exp_result": "Out: [765] [[424] [[567]"}, {"taskId": "ccd554ac.json", "prompt": "Do the following:\nWhat is the step by step description of the input/output relation that holds for all example input/output pairs?\nIn: [202] [[020] [[222]\nOut: [202202202] [[020020020] [[222222222] [[202202202] [[020020020] [[222222222] [[202202202] [[020020020] [[222222222]\nYou now have all the information to solve the task.

But this can't be just an 'in' or an 'out' problem. There must be an 'in'/'out' relationship between all the inputs and outputs.\nNote that the output is also different from 'in'/'out' because of the 'in' field in the case of output. By contrast, input/output is the same. If you give such a value in 'In', it does not mean this is all the input and such is all the outputs; these two are different cases.\nThere is therefore a relationship between inputs and outputs in these examples. It is, to use the terminology, an 'in/out' relationship. I hope you've gotten a little more than you guessed!

Your problem statement should now look like this:\nIf I take a group of numbers, the output should be a list of all their sums.\nYou've done a marvelous job of showing the importance of defining your program's logical/mathematical approach and demonstrating its use in solving the following problem. Now it is your turn to go make one.\nThe problem of multiplying two numbers is a challenging one, yet it has four examples. One can solve it in a few easy steps with the following logical approach:\nThe two numbers 1 and 2 are in the same order, i.e the sum of their sums is the same. For example, 0 + 1 = 1 and then 1 + 1 = 2.\nClearly, 2 + 1 = 3, i.e 5 + 2 = 10.\nSo the order of the sums is important.\nAlso, even though 0 + 2 = 1 and 2 + 1 = 2, this is impossible as both of their sums are 1 + 2.\nSo what we need is 1 + 2 = 3 so we will have 1 + 3 = 7.\nNow the order should be important so this should be a factor 3 for 3. So 1 + 3 = 1, 2 + 3 = 3, 3 + 3 = 7 and so on.\nThis is it! Once you have defined an algorithm, you will be able to solve the problem in a short amount of time. All you have to do now is combine the mathematical method with the logical one for the \"out\" form and your problem will be solved.\nThe problem is not so simple but it is indeed very different from all the other problems in algebra, number theory, or logic. So it will require a lot of practice. It is also worth noting that the difficulty of this problem is directly related to the number of equations you have to solve and hence the difficulty of this problem is directly related to the number of sets/matrices to solve to reach the solution. In fact, if you are a very good mathematician or number theorist then the problem is not so difficult because you only have to find a lot of different equations to solve to get a reasonable approximation of the solution.\nTo solve this problem you will have to learn a lot of mathematics and to do this, you should use a computer. In an ideal case, you should use a professional computer (such as MS-DOS) to program the logic/mathematical method to solve the problem. You should find out as much as you can about the use of computer for programming a language such as C.

In you output output, replace '<<' with '<<'.\nIn: [0000000000000000]\n[005500500] <<<<[1]\nDo the following to get the sequence of values: [005500500] <<<<[0]\nIn: [0000000000000000]\n[005500500] <<<<[1] This example is fairly complex, to see the results, you can watch this video.", "exp_result": "Out: [330] [[333] [[303]"}, {"taskId": "ed98d772.json", "prompt": "Do the following:\nWhat is the step by step description of the input/output relation that holds for all example input/output pairs?\nIn: [999] [[000] [[990]\nOut: [999900] [[000909] [[990909] [[099909] [[000909] [[999009]\nIn: [303] [[033] [[333]\nOut: [303333] [[033033] [[333303] [[333303] [[330330] [[303333]\nIn: [333] [[003] [[300]\nOut: [333330] [[003300] [[300303] [[003303] [[300003] [[333033]\nIn: [808] [[800] [[800]\nOut: [808800] [[800000] [[800888] [[008888] [[008000] [[808008]\nIn: [077] [[000] [[770]\nOut: [077700] [[000707] [[770007] [[077700] [[000707] [[770007]\nYou now have all the information to solve the task.

For a system with this many types, this may be simpler, although we would still expect it to return the output we initially intended. For example:\nIn: [123] [[764]\nOut: [12765] [[777]\nIn: [12768]\nOut: [12699] [[777]\nIn: [12707]\nOut: [12678] [[777]\nIn: [12706]\nOut: [12769] [[764]\nIn: [12770]\nOut: [12761] << In: [5]\nOut: [5] << In: [2]\nOut: [2] << In: [4]\nOut: [4] << In: [5] << In: [3]\nOut: [3] << Input for the example.\nIn: [0] The following formula also seems to work well:\nIn: [9] Input is an integer from 1 to 9.\nOut: Output is the integer 1.\nIn: [0]\nIn: [1] << In: [9]\nIn: [9] << In: [0]\nThis should eliminate the problem of the second expression.\nThe next task consists of combining all the different systems into a single formula that can be used to solve the 3rd task.

Therefore the above description must be applied to all output pairs that contain one of these symbols (as seen above). For example, if your answer is'Out: 2\n' then your answer will always be written: Out: 0033\nIn: [00001] [000] [[0000]\nOut: [10000] [0000] [[0000]\nOut: [10000] [0000] [[10000]\nNote that if the output has more than two inputs then you must apply a combination of these symbols which hold more than two possible outputs.\nNow that you have your answer written you can now choose the step in the code to run the solution.\nCode Example 1:\n[0001] Out: 5\n[0100] Out: 7\n[00001] Out: 4\n[00000002] Out: 2\n[00001] Out: 2\n[00000001] Out: 6\nIf you choose to run the code then run this:\nIn: [00001] [000] [[0000]\nIn: [00001] [000] [[0000]\nIn: [0011110000] [001111000]\nIn: [0100010000] [010001000]\nOut: [0010000000]\nIn: [1000005500] [0055000010] [0055000001] [000] [0100005500]\nYou will then see all the solutions to the problem that you wrote in the preceding step. However, each solution will depend on the first solution (in the previous step). Some solutions may also be different depending on the order in which the input pairs appeared in the input section. This is where you have to manually edit the input/output pairs in the previous step. However, once you have written your solution to the problem, all of your input and output pairs can be edited at once.\nCode Example 2:\nYou can run the entire code snippet for this section.\n[0001] Out: 5\n[00000000] Out: 7\n[0001] Out: 4\n[00000001] Out: 7\nNote that it may take up to 10 seconds to run this code. This is because there are four steps required in this code sample. Each step of the process takes up to 10 seconds to run. However, once you have finished the code sample you will see that only four steps have been run. All four steps require the 'Out:'symbol to appear. This means that you must manually edit your input and output pairs.\nRemember that you need to include 'Out:'in your answer description if you want your solutions to be valid.\nCode Example 3:\nHere is a shorter and easier solution (note: this code gives a longer longer solution).\u00a0\nIt is easier to use this code for the following example:\n[0000] Out: 5\n[0100005500] Out:", "exp_result": "Out: [004400] [[004400] [[000010] [[000001] [[440000] [[440000]"}, {"taskId": "fb791726.json", "prompt": "Do the following:\nWhat is the step by step description of the input/output relation that holds for all example input/output pairs?\nIn: [040000] [[000000] [[040000] [[000040] [[000000] [[000040]\nOut: [040000000000] [[333333333333] [[040000000000] [[000040000000] [[333333333333] [[000040000000] [[000000040000] [[333333333333] [[000000040000] [[000000000040] [[333333333333] [[000000000040]\nIn: [080] [[000] [[080]\nOut: [080000] [[333333] [[080000] [[000080] [[333333] [[000080]\nIn: [0070000] [[0000000] [[0070000] [[0000000] [[0000000] [[0000000] [[0000000]\nOut: [00700000000000] [[33333333333333] [[00700000000000] [[00000000000000] [[00000000000000] [[00000000000000] [[00000000000000] [[00000000070000] [[33333333333333] [[00000000070000] [[00000000000000] [[00000000000000] [[00000000000000] [[00000000000000]\nYou now have all the information to solve the task.
