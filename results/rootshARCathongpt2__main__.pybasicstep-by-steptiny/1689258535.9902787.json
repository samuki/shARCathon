In this graph, the vertices indicate a position, the edges indicate a direction, the x-z's indicate positions from where points are located within the graph, and the lines identify the possible values for position. All three examples contain only one \"in\" in the form '5'. On the right side of the graph there are three vertices. One of the values on the vertices specifies how you should position the three pieces, and the other two can be determined by comparing the values on the edge on which they are located. The third example contains one element of the two other elements.\nTo solve the task for example, you will need to compare one of the three positions, then add one to the other. We assume that you are given the position '5' of the graph (on your test inputs), and you want to remove one from place and add the other.\nYou would see that the diagram is as follows:\nFigure 3\nPosition of the three examples in that graph is the position where 3 pieces (one in each row) are located. If you know the position for example of the graph, you can then do all the steps to find all possible positions from that position.\nYou will need to go through all the possible pairs of examples that have a certain value for 'In' on the edge and identify which of these three examples is not a solution. You can refer back to the graph to get the positions of the elements shown (see Figure 2 above) to see which of the three positions is not a solution.\nThis is just that, a step by step description of the input/output relation used to solve the task. These types of information systems are becoming so sophisticated that we can expect more complicated task descriptions for them. This is the purpose of the data mining and machine learning techniques as we have seen.\nReferences:", "exp_result": "Out: 3 2 3 2 3 2; 7 8 7 8 7 8; 2 3 2 3 2 3; 8 7 8 7 8 7; 3 2 3 2 3 2; 7 8 7 8 7 8"}, {"prompt": "Do the following:\nWhat is the step by step description of the input/output relation that holds for all example input/output pairs?\nIn: 0 7 0; 7 7 7; 0 7 0\nOut: 0 0 0 7 0 7 0 0 0; 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0; 0 0 0 7 0 7 0 0 0; 7 0 7 7 0 7 7 0 7; 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0; 7 0 7 7 0 7 7 0 7; 0 0 0 7 0 7 0 0 0; 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0; 0 0 0 7 0 7 0 0 0\nIn: 0 0 6; 0 6 0; 6 0 0\nOut: 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 0; 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 6; 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6; 0 0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0; 0 0 0 6 0 6 0 0 0; 0 0 0 0 6 6 0 0 0; 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0; 6 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0; 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0\nIn: 4 4 0; 0 0 4; 0 0 4\nOut: 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 0; 4 4 0 4 4 0 0 0 0; 4 4 0 4 4 0 0 0 0; 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4; 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 0; 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 0; 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4; 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 0; 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 0\nYou now have all the information to solve the task.

The reason is pretty simple: they are examples of input and output pairs, as above, and you want to know how far back you think the output goes. This will help you to understand the problem better.\nIt's now time to solve the program and see how far you get.\nYour program should look like this:\nHow far back do you think the output goes?\nOut: 0 0 7 0 2 7 0 3 3 0\nIn: 7 0 0 2 5 7 0 7 0 0 2 0 2\nOut: 3 0 2 2 2 5 3 2 2\nIn: 0 0 2 0 0\nOut: 2 1 1 2 0 0\nIn: 7 0 7 0\n\n\nYour program can't solve the problem, but it can't do much wrong either. The solution is to think of the output as something that goes back to input.\nThis should help (after the problem is explained):\nIn: 0 0 6; 3 7 4; 0 0 6; 0 0 7 0\nOut: 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 0 0 6 0 0 0; 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 0;\nFor instance, in: 0 0 5; 6 0 7; 0 0 5\nOut: 7 7 7; 3 6 7\nIn: 0 0 5\nOut: 5\nIn: 0; 5\nOut: 7 7 7\nIn: 5\nIn: 6\nIn: 7\nIn: 7\nIn:\nIn: 7\nIn: 7\nIn: 5\nOut: 6\nIn:\nIn: 0; 0 0 0\nOut: 0\nIn: 0\nOut: 0\nIn: 0\nIn: 0\nIn: 0; 0 0 0\nOut: 3 3 7\nIn: 0 7 10 0\nIn: 6\nSo in the program above, it gets 2 back to input. The real question is which of the 8 pairs would be returned in the output. If it weren't for '0' in the '7' case, then we would have guessed '3', and if it had been anything but '5', then it would have been '2'.\nThe real answer depends on how far back you think the output goes. For instance in the '9' case, it is not the end of the input. In all other cases, the end is what is in front of your eyes (the back of your eyes!).\nIt's worth noting that if you want to prove beyond any doubt that a program works (and hence that it has been proven to be correct), you're not really solving this problem for'real' problems. You're solving it for ones that are more 'technical' problems and where your program doesn't have to do much that you can't do yourself. The problems that are'real' ones are those that", "exp_result": "Out: 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0; 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3; 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 3; 3 3 0 3 3 0 0 0 0; 0 0 3 0 0 3 0 0 0; 3 0 3 3 0 3 0 0 0; 0 0 0 3 3 0 0 0 0; 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0; 0 0 0 3 0 3 0 0 0"}, {"prompt": "Do the following:\nWhat is the step by step description of the input/output relation that holds for all example input/output pairs?\nIn: 6 2 4 2; 2 2 6 6; 6 4 2 4\nOut: 4 2 4 6 6 4 2 4; 6 6 2 2 2 2 6 6; 2 4 2 6 6 2 4 2; 2 4 2 6 6 2 4 2; 6 6 2 2 2 2 6 6; 4 2 4 6 6 4 2 4\nIn: 5 5 9 9; 9 5 5 5; 5 7 5 7\nOut: 7 5 7 5 5 7 5 7; 5 5 5 9 9 5 5 5; 9 9 5 5 5 5 9 9; 9 9 5 5 5 5 9 9; 5 5 5 9 9 5 5 5; 7 5 7 5 5 7 5 7\nIn: 3 3 5 5; 5 8 5 8; 8 8 5 8\nOut: 8 5 8 8 8 8 5 8; 8 5 8 5 5 8 5 8; 5 5 3 3 3 3 5 5; 5 5 3 3 3 3 5 5; 8 5 8 5 5 8 5 8; 8 5 8 8 8 8 5 8\nYou now have all the information to solve the task.
