There is so, so much to discover here \u2013 the most fascinating and important of which, I do believe, is, and has always been, the\u00a0 link to your subconscious.\u00a0 The secret to being a better person \u2013 a more conscious, more\u00a0 honest, and\u00a0 higher vibratory incarnation. \u00a0As in the last lesson, I will be discussing how to open your second gate and get into my heart, while leaving out the mundane aspects I will cover in this chapter. But before I do, this is the link. \u00a0If you ever had a chance to ask a person who you think is psychic, their response was always the same \u2013 they have no idea. \u00a0I understand that, and I believe I know as well \u2013 the only reason I can think of why they won't do a little reading, especially if they aren't psychic themselves, is because they don't want to \u2013 but that's because they just don't want to hear it. \u00a0 Why? \u00a0Because it's not really important to them. \u00a0If you tell them, \"Ok, so I'm going to tell you a secret; in the ancient wisdom tradition of your world they say\u00a0 that\u00a0 a person's karma is in the palm of your hand,\u00a0 and if\u00a0 you give your hand\u00a0 to someone,\u00a0 \u00a0they will gain a more powerful relationship with you, making themselves\u00a0 able\u00a0 \u00a0to do things you wouldn't want them to do,\" that person will say, \"Oh that's boring. \u00a0That's just a spiritual thing, I'm going to try and enjoy it anyway, it's the spirit of the thing.\" \u00a0They're tired of that. \u00a0They've got better things to do. \u00a0And then one day, a few years later, they come to you and ask you the same thing, and you say, \"Ok, I'm going to tell you a secret - the Karma Door is real, and\u00a0 I will open\u00a0 it\u00a0 for you.\" And then you go into trance, and you see their eyes, and you know how they're going to feel, and they know which path they're going to go down when they open. \u00a0And if it isn't what they want, they won't open. \u00a0If you don't open it, you will end up with a lot of trouble. \u00a0\nAnd they're not going to like that. \u00a0But they're going to do it anyway. \u00a0That's why I have to talk so much about it. \u00a0It's not something they can stop doing and say \"Oh okay, I didn't realize\u2026\"\u00a0\nAnyway, I know this because I do this. \u00a0As anyone who knows me knows, I do. \u00a0I do read every single book I get \u2013 I'm a pretty prolific reader. \u00a0I will happily explain to you the most complex concepts of the world for", "exp_result": "Out: 5 8 5 5 5 5 8 5; 8 8 7 7 7 7 8 8; 8 7 5 8 8 5 7 8; 8 7 5 8 8 5 7 8; 8 8 7 7 7 7 8 8; 5 8 5 5 5 5 8 5"}, {"prompt": "Continue the pattern\nIn: 4 4 6; 3 3 3; 6 6 4\nOut: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0; 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0; 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0; 4 4 6 4 4 6 4 4 6; 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3; 6 6 4 6 6 4 6 6 4; 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0; 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0; 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nIn: 2 4 3; 2 3 4; 2 3 4\nOut: 2 4 3 0 0 0 0 0 0; 2 3 4 0 0 0 0 0 0; 2 3 4 0 0 0 0 0 0; 2 4 3 0 0 0 0 0 0; 2 3 4 0 0 0 0 0 0; 2 3 4 0 0 0 0 0 0; 2 4 3 0 0 0 0 0 0; 2 3 4 0 0 0 0 0 0; 2 3 4 0 0 0 0 0 0\nIn: 1 1 1; 6 2 2; 2 2 6\nOut: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1; 6 2 2 6 2 2 6 2 2; 2 2 6 2 2 6 2 2 6; 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0; 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0; 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0; 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0; 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0; 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nIn: 3 1 6; 3 6 1; 3 1 6\nOut: 3 1 6 0 0 0 0 0 0; 3 6 1 0 0 0 0 0 0; 3 1 6 0 0 0 0 0 0; 3 1 6 0 0 0 0 0 0; 3 6 1 0 0 0 0 0 0; 3 1 6 0 0 0 0 0 0; 3 1 6 0 0 0 0 0 0; 3 6 1 0 0 0 0 0 0; 3 1 6 0 0 0 0 0 0\nIn: 6 6 3; 4 4 3; 4 4 3\nOut: ", "result": "\u00a00 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0; 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0; 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0; 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0; 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0; 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0; 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0; 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0; 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nIn: 1 1 1; 3 1 2; 2 7 1; 3 2 6; 6 6 3\nThis pattern looks pretty cool.
