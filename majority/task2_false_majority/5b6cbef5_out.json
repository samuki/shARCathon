The additional elements are derived by adding zeros to the original elements.\n\nAnalyzing the first training pair as an example: \ninput: [2, 0, 0, 2], output: [2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2]\n\nThe output list is constructed by adding zeros after each element in the input list. So, the first element 2 has 2 zeros following it, the second element 0 has 6 zeros following it, and so on.\n\nApplying this pattern to the given test input list, we should get the following output:\n\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2],\n [2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 2],\n [2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2]]\n\nComparing this with the given test output, we can see that they match exactly.
