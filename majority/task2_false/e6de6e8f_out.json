Confidence level: 95%. \n\nReasoning: Comparing the test output with the training output, we can see that some of the patterns match, such as the first and second rows of the test output matching the first row of the training output. However, there are differences in the third, fourth, and fifth rows of the test output. Therefore, it is likely that the test output is incorrect. However, with a confidence level of 95%, there is still a small chance that there is a valid pattern or reasoning behind these differences that we may have missed."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1282, "completion_tokens": 126, "total_tokens": 1408}}, "yes_answer": false, "no_answer": true, "confidence": "95"}
