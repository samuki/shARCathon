However, there is one discrepancy in the first row where the expected output is [2, 2, 0, 0] instead of [2, 2, 0, 1]. This suggests that there might be a mistake in the test output. Therefore, while the majority of the test output matches the expected patterns, there is some uncertainty due to the discrepancy in the first row."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1057, "completion_tokens": 129, "total_tokens": 1186}}, "yes_answer": true, "no_answer": false, "confidence": "80"}
