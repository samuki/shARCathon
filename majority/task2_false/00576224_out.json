The pattern observed in the training examples is that each element in the input list is repeated three times in the output list. Therefore, for the input [[3, 2], [7, 8]], the correct output would be [[3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2], [7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8], [2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3], [8, 7, 8, 7, 8, 7], [3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2], [7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8]].
