The test output is correct for the given input. The pattern observed in the training examples is that the input values are repeated in the output, padding the output with zeros as necessary. In this case, the input [6, 6, 3] is repeated as the first three elements of each row in the test output, with the remaining elements filled with zeros. Similarly, the input [4, 4, 3] is repeated in the test output."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1432, "completion_tokens": 102, "total_tokens": 1534}}, "yes_answer": true, "no_answer": false, "confidence": "100"}
