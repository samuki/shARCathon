However, there are some inconsistencies between the training examples and the test example, which lowers the confidence level. For example, in the first training example, the input [2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0] results in an output of [6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0]. But in the test input [2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], the output is predicted to be [6, 6, 0, 0, 3, 2, 2, 0]. While some patterns match up, the presence of the consecutive non-zero values in the middle of the test output is not fully consistent with the training examples."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2326, "completion_tokens": 214, "total_tokens": 2540}}, "yes_answer": false, "no_answer": true, "confidence": "75"}
