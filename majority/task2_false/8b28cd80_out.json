Similarly, when comparing the remaining rows, the numbers in the test output are also all 2 more than the corresponding numbers in the training output.\n\nTherefore, based on this pattern, the correct test output should be:\n[[4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4],\n [4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4],\n [4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4],\n [4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4],\n [4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4],\n [4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4],\n [4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4],\n [4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4],\n [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]]\n\nTherefore, my answer is no with a confidence level of 100%."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1707, "completion_tokens": 428, "total_tokens": 2135}}, "yes_answer": false, "no_answer": true, "confidence": "100"}
