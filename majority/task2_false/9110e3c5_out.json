For example, in the first training example, the input list has a count of 8 at index 2, so the corresponding output has a value of 8 at index 2. \n\nApplying this pattern to the test input, we can see that the count of numbers at index 2 in the input list is 8, so the corresponding output should also have a value of 8 at index 2. Similarly, the count of numbers at index 5 in the input list is 9, so the corresponding output should have a value of 9 at index 5. The remaining values can be determined in a similar manner."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1489, "completion_tokens": 172, "total_tokens": 1661}}, "yes_answer": true, "no_answer": false, "confidence": "90"}
