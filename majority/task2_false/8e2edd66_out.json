However, in the test output provided, this pattern is not followed consistently. For example, in the first row of the test output, the last two positions contain a 1 and a 0 respectively, which is opposite to what would be expected based on the training examples. This inconsistency suggests that the test output is not correct for the given input."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1157, "completion_tokens": 128, "total_tokens": 1285}}, "yes_answer": false, "no_answer": true, "confidence": "0"}
