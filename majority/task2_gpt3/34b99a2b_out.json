Confidence level: 90%. \n\nReasoning: We can see that the test output does not follow the patterns observed in the training data. For example, in the first row, all the even positions have a value of 2, while in the test output they have a value of 0. Also, in the fourth row, the pattern observed in the training data suggests that the second position should have a value of 2, not 0. Overall, there are inconsistencies between the observed patterns in the training data and the test output."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1057, "completion_tokens": 121, "total_tokens": 1178}}, "yes_answer": false, "no_answer": true, "confidence": "90"}
