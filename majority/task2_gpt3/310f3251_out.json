In the training pairs, the first element in each input sublist is always a repeating pattern of [0, 2, 2, 0], and the second element is always a repeating pattern of [0, 7, 7, 7]. However, in the test output, the first element in each sublist does not follow this pattern and the second element is not consistently 0 or 7.
