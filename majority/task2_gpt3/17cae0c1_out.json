In the training examples, when there are three 5's and six 0's in a row, the corresponding output is three 1's followed by six 9's. Similarly, when there are three 0's and six 5's in a row, the output is three 9's followed by six 1's. \n\nIn the given test input, the first row has five 5's followed by four 0's, which matches the pattern for three 5's and six 0's in the training data. Therefore, the corresponding output should be three 1's followed by six 9's. \n\nThe same logic applies to the second and third rows of the test input, resulting in the output of three 1's followed by six 9's for each row.\n\nSince the patterns observed in the training examples are consistent with the test output, we can be confident that the test output is correct."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 892, "completion_tokens": 211, "total_tokens": 1103}}, "yes_answer": true, "no_answer": false, "confidence": "100"}
