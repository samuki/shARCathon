In the first training example, we see that values in the original input are replaced with consecutive numbers starting from 1 and any repeating values are removed. However, in the test output, there are some discrepancies. For example, the second row in the test output should have a 0 replaced with a 3, but instead, it remains as 0. Additionally, the third row in the test output should have a 1 replaced with a 3, but instead, it is replaced with a 1. Overall, the test output does not follow the observed patterns from the training examples."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 919, "completion_tokens": 143, "total_tokens": 1062}}, "yes_answer": false, "no_answer": true, "confidence": "0"}
