In the input [[5, 0, 0], [5, 5, 0], [5, 0, 0]], the output is [[0, 4, 4], [0, 0, 4], [0, 4, 4]], which suggests that in the case of a tie between two input values, the output should take the maximum value instead of the minimum. \n\nApplying this pattern to the test input [[3, 0, 0], [3, 3, 3], [0, 0, 3]], we would expect the output to be [[0, 3, 3], [0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 0]], since there is a tie between the input values of 3.
